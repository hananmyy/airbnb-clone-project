# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

## Database Design

### 1. Users
Fields: id, name, email, password, role (host/guest)  
**Relationships**:
- Can list multiple properties (if host)
- Can make multiple bookings (if guest)
- Can write reviews

### 2. Properties
Fields: id, title, location, price, host_id  
**Relationships**:
- Belongs to a host (user)
- Can have many bookings and reviews

### 3. Bookings
Fields: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date  
**Relationships**:
- Belongs to a user and a property

### 4. Reviews
Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment  
**Relationships**:
- Written by a user for a property

### 5. Payments
Fields: id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_date  
**Relationships**:
- Linked to a booking

## Feature Breakdown

### 2. User Authentication

- **Endpoints**: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
- **Features**: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### 3. Property Management

- **Endpoints**: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- **Features**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System

- **Endpoints**: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
- **Features**: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### 5. Payment Processing

- **Endpoints**: /payments/
- **Features**: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### 6. Review System

- **Endpoints**: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
- **Features**: Post and manage reviews for properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations

- **Indexing**: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

### Key API Security Measures

- Authentication (JWT/OAuth2): Verifies user identity.
- Authorization: Controls access based on roles.
- Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and DDoS.
- Input Validation: Blocks malicious data.
- HTTPS: Encrypts data in transit.
- API Keys: Secures internal services.

### Why It's Important

- Protect user data (e.g., medical info)
- Prevent unauthorized actions (e.g., admin access)
- Ensure system reliability
- Meet legal requirements (e.g., GDPR)

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

**Importance**  
- Catch bugs early through automated testing (CI)  
- Speed up and standardize deployments (CD)  

**Tools commonly used**  
- GitHub Actions – for automating workflows  
- Docker – for containerizing applications  
- Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI – for advanced pipeline management
