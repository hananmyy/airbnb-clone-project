# airbnb-clone-project

# Overview
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

# Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
** 1. Users **
Fields: id, name, email, password, role (host/guest)
** Relationships: **
- Can list multiple properties (if host)
- Can make multiple bookings (if guest)
- Can write reviews
** 2. Properties **
Fields: id, title, location, price, host_id
** Relationships: **
- Belongs to a host (user)
- Can have many bookings and reviews
** 3. Bookings **
Fields: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date
** Relationships: **
- Belongs to a user and a property
** 4. Reviews **
Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment
** Relationships: **
- Written by a user for a property
** 5. Payments **
Fields: id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_date
** Relationships: **
- Linked to a booking

# Feature Breakdown
** 1. API Documentation **
  - OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
  - Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
  - GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
** 2. User Authentication **
  - Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
  - Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
** 3. Property Management **
  - Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
  - Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
** 4. Booking System **
  - Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
  - Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out       details.
** 5. Payment Processing **
  - Endpoints: /payments/
  - Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
** 6. Review System **
  - Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
  - Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
** 7. Database Optimizations **
  - Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
  - Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

# API Security
** Key API Security Measures: **
- Authentication (JWT/OAuth2): Verifies user identity.
- Authorization: Controls access based on roles.
- Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and DDoS.
- Input Validation: Blocks malicious data.
- HTTPS: Encrypts data in transit.
- API Keys: Secures internal services.

** Why It's Important: **
- Protect user data (e.g., medical info)
- Prevent unauthorized actions (e.g., admin access)
- Ensure system reliability
- Meet legal requirements (e.g., GDPR)

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

** Importance ** 
Catch bugs early through automated testing (CI)
Speed up and standardize deployments (CD)

** Tools commonly used: **
GitHub Actions – for automating workflows
Docker – for containerizing applications
Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI – for advanced pipeline management
